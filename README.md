# Event Scheduler project

The Event Scheduler project is a React-based application designed to enhance your skills by interacting with real data through a RESTful API.

Key Features:

    User Authentication: Implement user sign-up and sign-in functionalities to manage user sessions.

    Event Management: Allow users to create, view, and manage events, with data stored and retrieved via a RESTful API.

    Protected Routes: Ensure certain pages, like the event creation page, are accessible only to authenticated users.

    Responsive Design: Utilize TailwindCSS for styling, ensuring the application is responsive and user-friendly.

    Routing: Employ React Router DOM for seamless navigation between different pages.

    State Management: Manage application state effectively using React’s state and effect hooks.

    LocalStorage Integration: Store and retrieve the API key using localStorage for persistent access.

This project provides hands-on experience in building interactive web applications with React, focusing on real-world data handling and user authentication. By the end of this project, you’ll have a solid understanding of integrating React with RESTful APIs, managing user sessions, & creating dynamic, data-driven applications.
